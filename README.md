# Fiery Dragon
Fiery Dragon is a game based on a board game of the same name.
This assignments goal was to digitalize that game. This was a group project, I do not claim it as solely my own. 

The games code is within the Game folder. All documentation regarding this is within the Project docs folder; see [Sprint 4 Deliverables](https://github.com/Rango-Cham/Fiery-Dragon/blob/main/Project%20docs/Sprint_4_Deliverables.pdf) on how to install and run the application.
